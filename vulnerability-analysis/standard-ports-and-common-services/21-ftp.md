# 21 - FTP

Many FTP-servers allow anonymous users. These might be badly configured and give too much access, and anonymous access is sometimes required for exploits. Always try to log in with `anonymous:anonymous`, `anonymous:` \(blank password\) or `anonymous:password`!

FTP has two modes: **Binary** and **ASCII**. Keep this in mind to avoid file corruption!

### Nmap scripts:

`nmap -sV -Pn -vv -p <PORT> --script=ftp-anon,ftp-bounce,ftp-libopie,ftp-proftpd-backdoor,ftp-vsftpd-backdoor,ftp-vuln-cve2010-4221 <IP-ADDRESS>`

### Hydra brute force attack:

`hydra -s <PORT> -C <path/to/wordlist.txt> -u -f <IP-ADDRESS> ftp`
