# Resources

## Links

Here is my preliminary best-of of resources for pentesting:

* [https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker/](https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker/)
* [https://highon.coffee/blog/](https://highon.coffee/blog/)
* [https://sushant747.gitbooks.io/total-oscp-guide/](https://sushant747.gitbooks.io/total-oscp-guide/)

And a useful resource aggregation:

* [https://github.com/AnasAboureada/Penetration-Testing-Study-Notes/blob/master/bookmarks.md](https://github.com/AnasAboureada/Penetration-Testing-Study-Notes/blob/master/bookmarks.md)

The following sub-sections contain many more links, sorted by category. The goal of this collection is to include as much functionality as possible, so the techniques described there will be integrated here at some point.
