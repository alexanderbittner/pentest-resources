# Penetration Testing Resources

## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

This is my personal collection of useful tools, information and methodology for Penetration Testing.

It is meant to be a personal reference and has been collected from all over the internet. I try to provide sources for further reading where possible. Hopefully it can be useful for you too!

Please note that I am by no means an expert in Penetration Testing. If you have any tips on improving this collection or the methodology behind it, please let me know!
