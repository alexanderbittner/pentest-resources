# Penetration Testing Resources

## Introduction

This is my personal collection of useful tools, information and methodology for Penetration Testing.

It is meant to be a personal reference and has been collected from all over the internet. I try to provide sources for further reading where possible. Hopefully it can be useful for you too!

Read the gitbook \(linked to this repository\) here: [https://alexanderbittner.gitbook.io/pentest-resources/](https://alexanderbittner.gitbook.io/pentest-resources/)

Or, if you come from the book, see the repository for additional tools here: [https://github.com/alexanderbittner/pentest-resources/](https://github.com/alexanderbittner/pentest-resources/)

If you have any tips on improving this collection or the methodology behind it, please let me know!

## Roadmap

This document is still in a very early stage. There are many things still missing, but below is a roadmap with things that definitely should be added at some point \(in no particular order\):

* Social Engineering
* Mobile security
* More common vulnerabilities
* Buffer overflows
