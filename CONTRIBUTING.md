# Contributing to pentest-resources

Would you like to contribute some information to this repository? Awesome! Here's how:

## How to contribute

If you have something you'd like to contribute, it's probably a good idea to create an issue with a feature request first.
If your change is a simple error correction or a small addition, I can just add it in without all the fuzz.
In case your contribution is larger, the best option is to create a new branch, put your changes in, and submit a pull request.
I'll review your request as soon as I can!

## File structure

If possible, try to stick to the existing structure, both regarding files and within text documents.
Keeping it simple is important here.
Do you have a suggestion on how to improve the file structure? Let me know!
